## Description

This app will will allow a user to validate their test model for a basic linear regression assessment and produce a graph based on the resulting data.



##### Controls

<ul>
    <li>Once the app is properly set up and run, the user will be prompted to enter<ul>
        <li>the name of the training data file (without ".csv")</li>
        <li>the name of the testing data file (without ".csv")</li>            
        <li>the desired learning rate for the model</li>
        <li>the desired scale factor for the label for the model<ul>
            <li>if the value of the data is too large this may be beneficial</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>the label to be predicted</li>
        <li>the feature</li>
        <li>and the desired size of the training set to pull from the training set data</li></ul>
    <li>After the user has entered appropriate values to the prompts a graph will be generated and presented based on the data</li>
</ul>
